<!-- <h2>General Information</h2> -->
<p>
  If you have any specific questions about our work, please email
  <a href="{{ '/people/' | relative_url }}">Tapo</a> with
  <strong>EmPRISE21</strong> in your email subject and your CV. Though he tries
  to respond to all the emails, the sheer volume of emails sometimes gets the
  better of him. So, this code is just so that he can focus on emails from
  people who have taken some time to read about our lab.
</p>

<h2>Ph.D. Applicants</h2>
<p>
  We always welcome self-motivated and hard-working students
  <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}"
    >who share our research interests and are passionate about our mission</a
  >. If you are looking for a Ph.D. position, please read about our admission
  requirements
  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions" target="_blank">here</a>.
  Unfortunately, we are not going to be able to reply to generic admissions
  related questions via email. If you are interested in working with Tapo, we
  would suggest applying to Cornell's CS Department and mentioning his name in
  your application packet.
</p>

<h2>Masters and Undergraduates</h2>
<p>
  If you are a Master's or an Undergraduate student researcher at Cornell who is
  interested in working with us, please use the same code above in your email
  subject and send an email to <code>empriselab21 at gmail.com</code> with your
  CV and transcripts. We do not fund master's or undergraduate student
  researchers when they just start out with the lab. We do offer research
  credits. Typically, you would end up working with a Ph.D. student mentor, if
  available. You are expected to commit to at least 10 hours per week and a
  minimum of 2 semesters in the lab.
</p>

<h2>Postdocs</h2>
<p>
  Currently, we are not actively looking for any external internship students
  and postdoctoral candidates. But we are always opportunistic. So please do not
  hesitate to write to us in case you feel like there is a great fit.
