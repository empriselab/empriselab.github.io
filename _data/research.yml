  description: "Eating is an activity of daily living (ADL) and losing the
  ability to self-feed can be devastating. Robots have the potential to help
  with these tasks. Successful robotic assistive feeding depends on reliable
  bite acquisition, appropriate bite timing, and easy bite transfer in both
  individual and social dining settings. Automating bite acquisition is
  daunting as the universe of foods, cutlery, and human strategies is
  massive and the activity demands robust nonprehensile manipulation
  of a deformable hard-to-model target. Bite timing, especially in social
  dining settings, is a delicate dance of multimodal signaling
  (via gaze, facial expressions, gestures, and speech, to name a few),
  action, and sometimes coercion. Bite transfer constitutes a unique
  type of robot-human handover where the human needs to use the mouth.
  Through this project, we are developing algorithms and technologies
  that can address these challenges towards a robotic system that 
  can autonomously feed people with upper-extremity mobility
  limitations in real homes."

  description: "We introduce RCareWorld, a simulation for robotic caregiving
  created with input from care-recipients, caregivers, therapists, and 
  roboticists. It features realistic models of humans with mobility challenges, 
  diverse home environments, assistive tools, and caregiving robots. RCareWorld
  works with multiple physics engines for accurate caregiving simulations,
  supports planning and learning control policies, and integrates with 
  external libraries and VR devices. We offer caregiving tasks as benchmarks
  and provide control policies. We demonstrate RCareWorld's accuracy by 
  showing a policy's real-world execution and gaining clinical stakeholder
  approval for its realism. We also conduct a real-world social robotic 
  caregiving experiment using behaviors in RCareWorld. Our goal is to 
  simplify access to the interdisciplinary robotic caregiving field by 
  offering a comprehensive simulation platform."

  description: "Being able to eat independently with friends and family is 
  considered one of the most memorable and important activities for people 
  with mobility limitations. Robots can potentially help with this activity
  but robot-assisted feeding is a multi-faceted problem with challenges in
  bite acquisition, bite timing, and bite transfer. Bite timing in particular
  becomes uniquely challenging in social dining scenarios due to the 
  possibility of interrupting a social human-robot group interaction during
  commensality. Through this project we are developing bite timing 
  strategies that take into account the delicate balance of social cues
  can lead to seamless interactions during robot-assisted feeding in a
  social dining scenario."

  description: "Eating is a fundamental activity of daily living (ADL), yet for
  millions of people with mobility limitations around the globe, meal
  preparation poses significant challenges. While existing research has explored
  robotic assistance in meal preparation tasks like cutting and cooking, the
  crucial task of peeling has received less attention. Our robot-assisted 
  peeling system uses visual, tactile, and auditory sensing modalities to peel a
  diverse range of food items with varying physical properties and can successfully
  adapt to different environments featuring multiple specialized cutting boards."

  ytid: "kA-X0yzWJvs"
  description: "Whole-arm tactile feedback is crucial for robots to ensure safe 
  physical interactions with their surroundings and the humans therein. In this 
  paper, we introduce CushSense, a fabric-based tactile sensing skin designed 
  for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) tasks such as robotic caregiving. 
  Utilizing a combination of stretchable fabric and hyper-elastic polymer, 
  CushSense identifies contacts by monitoring capacitive changes due to skin 
  deformation. Designed for comprehensive robot coverage, it fosters both safe 
  and comfortable interactions. CushSense is cost-effective ($387 USD) and easily 
  fabricated. We detail the sensor design and fabrication processes, provide 
  characterization results showcasing its sensing proficiency, and present a 
  user study underscoring its perceived safety and comfort for the assistive 
  task of limb manipulation. All sensor-related resources are open source on 
  our website."

  description: "We propose Structuring Physically Assistive Robotics for 
  Caregiving with Stakeholders-in-the-loop (SPARCS) to address these challenges.
  SPARCS is a framework for physical robot caregiving comprising (i) Building 
  Blocks, models that define physical robot caregiving scenarios, (ii) Structured
  Workflows, hierarchical workflows that enable us to answer the Whats and 
  Hows of physical robot caregiving, and (iii) SPARCS-Box, a web-based platform
  to facilitate dialogue between all stakeholders. We collect clinical data 
  for six care recipients with varying disabilities and demonstrate the use 
  of SPARCS in designing well-defined caregiving scenarios and identifying 
  their care requirements. All the data and workflows are available on SPARCS-Box.
  We demonstrate the utility of SPARCS in building a robot-assisted feeding 
  system for one of the care recipients. We also perform experiments to show the 
  adaptability of this system to different caregiving scenarios. Finally, we 
  identify open challenges in physical robot caregiving by consulting care 
  recipients and caregivers."

  description: "Physical interactions between robots and humans are inevitable
  and desired during caregiving. Tactile sensing can enable a robot to infer
  properties of its surroundings from planned and incidental contact during
  manipulation in unstructured human environments. Through this project, we are 
  developing solutions that can efficiently combine multimodal sensing and 
  perception to develop intelligent planning and control policies for safe and 
  efficient manipulation with and around humans."
