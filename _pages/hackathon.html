  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Welcome to our hackathon! This is where you can find information about our event. RCareWorld is a simulation platform designed for human-centric caregiving scenarios involving physical and social robots. It incorporates realistic human modeling, home environments, and benchmark ADL tasks, drawing on input from experts and stakeholders. By interfacing with various physics engines and external planning and learning libraries, RCareWorld facilitates the development and evaluation of robot-assisted caregiving technologies in diverse and dynamic simulated environments. To learn more about <a href="https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/rcareworld">RCareWorld</a> please click the link.</p>

  <h3>What to Expect</h3>
  <p>Use <a href="https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/rcareworld">RCareWorld</a> to perform two caregiving activities:</p>

  <h4>Task 1: Robot assisted bathing</h4>
  <p>The setup has a care recipient lying down on a bed. Participants will need to program a mobile robot (Stretch) to perform bed bathing. The robot needs to wipe the body of the care recipient as much as possible while maintaining contact force within a certain threshold for comfort.</p>

  <h4>Task 2: Robot assisted dressing</h4>
  <p>The setup has a care recipient sitting on a chair. Participants will need to program a fixed base robot (Kinova Gen 3 7Dof) to dress the care recipient with a hospital gown. The robot needs to put the gown on one arm, pull the other sleeve to the other arm, and then pull it up to dress the other arm.</p>

  <p>Participants will have the freedom to use both learning-based and non-learning-based methods to program the robot. Evaluation will be based on task completion, time, and other task-specific criteria.</p>

  <p>More details will be released in March.</p>
