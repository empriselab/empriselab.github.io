title: How to apply?

<p>
  We always welcome self-motivated and hard-working students
  <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}">who share our research interests and are passionate about our mission.</a>
</p>

<h2>Ph.D. Applicants</h2>
<p>
  If you are looking for a Ph.D. position, please read about our admission
  requirements for <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions">CS</a>,
  <a
    href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/phd-program/phd-admission-process">ECE</a>, and
  <a
    href="https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae/programs/graduate-programs/phd-degree/admissions">MAE</a>
  as we may be looking for students across all these departments. Unfortunately,
  we are not going to be able to reply to generic admissions related questions
  via email. If you are interested in working with Tapo, we would suggest
  applying to the above departments based on your preference and mentioning his
  name in your application packet. Emailing Tapo regarding open positions in lab or
  admissions may not lead to replies. Though he tries to respond to most of the emails,
  the sheer volume of emails sometimes gets the better of him. The best way to join
  the lab is to just apply to the departments mentioned above and let the official
  admissions process take its course.

<h2>M.S., M.Eng., and Undergraduates</h2>
<p>
  If you are a Master's or an Undergraduate student researcher at Cornell who is
  interested in working with us, please send an email to
  <code>empriselab21 at gmail dot com</code> with your CV and transcripts. We
  do not typically fund master's or undergraduate student researchers. We do
  offer research credits. Typically, you would end up working with a Ph.D.
  student mentor, if available. You are expected to commit to at least 10
  hours per week and a minimum of 2 semesters in the lab.
</p>

<p>
  Note, we will not accept students who are working in multiple labs at the same time. 
  From our experience, it becomes very challenging for a student to do meaningful work if they 
  have research responsibilities in multiple labs on top of their course work.
</p>

<h2>Postdocs and External Interns</h2>
<p>
  Postdoctoral candidates should directly email Tapo with their CV. If you want
  to intern with us and are not at Cornell currently, please write to Tapo
  directly with your CV.
