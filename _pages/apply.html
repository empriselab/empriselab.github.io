<p>
  We always welcome self-motivated and hard-working students
  <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}">who share our research interests and are passionate about our mission.</a>
</p>

<h2>Ph.D. Applicants</h2>
<p>
  If you are looking for a Ph.D. position, please read about our admission
  requirements for <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions">CS</a>,
  <a
    href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/phd-program/phd-admission-process">ECE</a>, and
  <a
    href="https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae/programs/graduate-programs/phd-degree/admissions">MAE</a>
  as we may be looking for students across all these departments. Unfortunately,
  we are not going to be able to reply to generic admissions related questions
  via email. If you are interested in working with Tapo, we would suggest
  applying to the above departments based on your preference and mentioning his
  name in your application packet. If you have any specific questions about our
  work, please email
  <a href="https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/people/">Tapo</a> with
  <strong>EmPRISE21</strong> in your email subject and your CV. Though he tries
  to respond to all the emails, the sheer volume of emails sometimes gets the
  better of him. So, this code is just so that he can focus on emails from
  people who have taken some time to read about our lab.
</p>

<h2>M.S., M.Eng., and Undergraduates</h2>
<p>
  If you are a Master's or an Undergraduate student researcher at Cornell who is
  interested in working with us, please send an email to
  <code>empriselab21 at gmail dot com</code> with your CV and transcripts. We
  do not typically fund master's or undergraduate student researchers. We do
  offer research credits. Typically, you would end up working with a Ph.D.
  student mentor, if available. You are expected to commit to at least 10
  hours per week and a minimum of 2 semesters in the lab.
</p>

<h2>Postdocs and External Interns</h2>
<p>
  Postdoctoral candidates should directly email Tapo with their CV. If you want
  to intern with us and are not at Cornell currently, please write to us at
  <code>empriselab21 at gmail dot com</code>.
